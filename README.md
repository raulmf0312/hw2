Due to the recent drama with Megexit, I was inspired to make a joke website for a fictitious PR firm "Crown & King CO." that manages the public view of royal families and religious organizations. It is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek and not serious at all and that is why I have included a disclaimer at the bottom of each page.
I have created three different pages for the home page, the business model, and the about us with a sitemap at the bottom for navigation. 
In the future, I want to learn placement, sizing, and styling of text and images as well as to create a more extensive menu of navigation at the top.
